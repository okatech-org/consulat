# Code Analysis First

Before implementing any new code:

1. **Examine existing codebase** for similar patterns and implementations
2. **Reuse existing solutions** unless they are clearly less optimized
3. **Check available resources** (routers, hooks, actions, components) to avoid duplication
4. **Follow established patterns** found in the codebase
5. **Never create redundant code** - always look for existing utilities first

# Project-Specific Rules

- **tRPC Usage**: Always use the existing `api` object from `@/trpc/react` with established routers
- **Profile Handling**: Check existing profile routers and hooks before creating new ones
- **Component Patterns**: Follow established UI patterns in `/src/components/ui`
- **Server Actions**: Use existing actions in `/src/actions` or extend them appropriately
- **Translations**: Add to existing translation files, don't create new structures

# Architecture Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/component should have one clear purpose
- **Composition over Creation**: Extend existing rather than building from scratch
- **Convention over Configuration**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
