Components should follow these conventions:
- Use named exports instead of default exports
- Place in appropriate directory under src/components
- Follow kebab-case naming convention
- Implement as Server Components by default
- Add 'use client' directive only when needed
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Shadcn UI components when possible

UI Components:
- Base components in src/components/ui
- Layout components in src/components/layouts
- Feature components in src/components/{feature-name}
- Use Radix UI primitives for complex interactions
- Implement Framer Motion for animations

Forms:
- Use react-hook-form for form state
- Implement Zod schemas for validation
- Place form schemas in src/schemas/{model}.ts
- Use FormField compound components from shadcn/ui
