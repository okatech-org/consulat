- **Primitive Building Blocks:** Use Radix UI primitives as fundamental components for constructing custom UI elements.
- **Accessibility:** Implement proper accessibility features; leverage Radix UI's built-in accessibility props (`aria-*`).
- **Customization:** Customize Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS classes, adhering to the defined design system.
-   **Composition:** Compose Radix UI components together (or with your custom primitives!) to build higher-level components.
