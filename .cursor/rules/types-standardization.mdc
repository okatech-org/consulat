- **Single Directory**: Place all custom type definitions within the `/src/types/` directory for better maintainability and discoverability.
- **Modular Files:** Break type definitions into smaller, focused files (e.g., `profile.ts`, `documents.ts`, `organization.ts`), improving readability and maintainability.
- **Descriptive Types:** Name the types clearly; keep types organized
-   **Utilize Prisma Types to the fulles**: Use Prisma type generation (`Prisma.ModelGetPayload<...>`) to ensure seamless integration with the database and prevent data type mismatches
