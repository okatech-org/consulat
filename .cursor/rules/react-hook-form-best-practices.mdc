- **Zod Validation**: Apply Zod schemas consistently to all forms, leveraging `zodResolver` to connect schema validation to `useForm`.

- **Controlled Form Data**: Ensure that React Hook Form's controlled components are used to manage form state, ensuring tight integration with the hook. For libraries such as `react select`, use the `Controller` component

- **Translation Hooks for Labels and Messages:** Embed `useTranslations` effectively to translate labels, options, descriptions, and validation messages, making the application easily adaptable to multi-language support, leveraging a structure with `messages.ts`
