- **File Tree Existence**: Verify the presence of a file named `.tree.md` in the root directory.
- **Up-to-date Tree**:
  - Compare the contents of `.tree.md` with the current project file structure to ensure the tree is up-to-date.
  - If the file tree is outdated, generate a new one.
- **Git Addition**: Confirm `.tree.md` is added to the commit.
