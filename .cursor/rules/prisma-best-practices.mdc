- **Centralized Prisma Client:** Use a single, centrally managed Prisma Client instance (`src/lib/prisma.ts`) to avoid connection issues and improve performance.
- **Consistent Error Handling:** Implement consistent and informative error handling for all database operations, logging errors with context.
- **Transaction Management:** Utilize Prisma's transaction API (`prisma.$transaction`) for operations that require atomicity, consistency isolation and durability (ACID).
- **Schema Migrations:** Regularly run `prisma migrate dev` to ensure your Prisma schema is synchronized with the database.
- **Model Relationships:** Explicitly define relationships between entities in your Prisma schema (e.g. Post-Category relation, User-Profile relation) using the `@relation` directive. Take advantage of Prisma client type generation for those
- **Types**: Explicitly declare types for all variables and params when interaction with Prisma Client orm.
- **Eager Loading of Required Relation:** Use `include` or `select` to eager load related records that are always required and reduce the number of database roundtrips.
