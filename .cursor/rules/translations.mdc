description: Translation Keys Management
globs: /locales
---
Key Structure:
- the trad files are put in /locales folder
- Use nested dot notation (e.g., "feature.section.key")
- Group by feature or module first
- Keep hierarchy depth <= 3 levels
- Use camelCase for key names
- Avoid dynamic key generation

Common Patterns:
- actions: "{action}.{state}" (e.g., "submit.success")
- errors: "{scope}.{type}" (e.g., "form.required")
- titles: "{feature}.{page}.title"
- buttons: "{action}.{context}" (e.g., "save.profile")
- messages: "{type}.{context}" (e.g., "success.update")

Variables:
- Use {placeholder} syntax for variables
- Document required variables in comments
- Keep variable names descriptive
- Use consistent naming across translations
- Handle pluralization with {count}

Organization:
- Always use translation for all texts the user will see
- By default generate/edit translation for fr.json
- Split files by major features
- Keep shared strings in common.json
- Group validation messages
- Maintain consistent structure across locales
- Document complex translation patterns
