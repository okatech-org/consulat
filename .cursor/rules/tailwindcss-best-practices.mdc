- **Utility Classes:** Use Tailwind utility classes directly in JSX for styling.
- **Custom Components:** Create custom React components with predefined Tailwind classes for reusability.
-   **DRY Principle:** To follow DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principle, add tailwind classes directly in `/@/components/ui`, and reuse them in features implementation
    **Avoid Tailwind Plugin:** You should add the `darkMode` configurations but avoid to create a plugin which create un-necessary abstraction and code
- **Prefix**: Respect the configuration of prefix `""` in your files
- **Responsive Design:** Use Tailwind's responsive modifiers (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) for adaptive layouts.
- **`theme.extend`**: To extend the current configuration you need to check the `./tailwind.config.ts` theme configurations
- **No Raw Css properties**: You must only use values defined in the tailwind config file.
- **`@layer`**: You must apply rules base on each layer, and define comment where it's comming from.
