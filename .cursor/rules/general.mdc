- **Prefer `const` over `let` and `var`:**  Use `const` for variables that will not be reassigned, `let` for values that change, and avoid `var`.
- **Use Early Returns:** Employ early returns to simplify function logic and make code more readable.
- **Descriptive Naming:** Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and components, improving code clarity.
- **Strict Typing:** Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary, and always justify its use with comments. Prefer explicit TypeScript types.
- **Code Comments for Complex Logic:** Explain complex algorithms, critical sections, and non-obvious implementation details using concise inline comments.
- **Error Handling:** Implement `try...catch` blocks to handle possible errors. Create custom error class and use `instanceof` to ensure that error handling are well managed
- **Exhaustivité:** When using Discriminated Unions, ensure exhaustivity in switch/case statements to prevent logical errors.  Use "if (/* Typescript should raise an error */)"
