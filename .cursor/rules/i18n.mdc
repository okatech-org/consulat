# Internationalization Rules

- "**/*.{ts,tsx}": "Use next-intl for all user-facing strings"
- "**/*.{ts,tsx}": "Use descriptive translation keys (e.g., component.button.submit)"
- "**/*.{ts,tsx}": "Wrap components with NextIntlClientProvider in layout.tsx"
- "**/*.{ts,tsx}": "Ensure all text content is internationalized"
- "**/*.{ts,tsx}": "Document i18n keys and their usage patterns"
