-   **Prioritize UI Components**: Try to favor component from '/src/components/ui' before creating new. Use a chat bot before if needed.
-   **Existing Component Checklist**: Before implementing new you must refer to previous implementation and existing documentation to understand the need and use component.
-   **Shadcn UI focus**: Favour the choice of Shadcn component and if it's not possible use a similar component from radix
-   **Compond pattern**: use component composition instead of create redundant components
